** Analog to Digital Bridge
* The adc_bridge is one of two node bridge devices designed to allow for the
* ready transfer of analog information to digital values and back again. The second
* device is the dac_bridge (which takes a digital value and maps it to an analog one).
* The adc_bridge takes as input an analog value from an analog node. This value
* by definition may be in the form of a voltage, or a current. If the input value is
* less than or equal to in_low, then a digital output value of ‘0’ is generated. If the
* input is greater than or equal to in_high, a digital output value of ‘1’ is generated.
* If neither of these is true, then a digital ‘UNKNOWN’ value is output. Note that
* unlike the case of the dac_bridge, no ramping time or delay is associated with the
* adc_bridge. Rather, the continuous ramping of the input value provides for any
* associated delays in the digitized signal.
