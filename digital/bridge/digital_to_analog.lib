** to Digital to Analog Bridge
*  The dac_bridge is the first of two node bridge devices designed to allow for
* the ready transfer of digital information to analog values and back again. The second
* device is the adc_bridge (which takes an analog value and maps it to a digital
* one).The dac_bridge takes as input a digital value from a digital node. This value
* by definition may take on only one of the values ‘0’, ‘1’ or ‘U’. The dac_bridge then
* outputs the value out_low, out_high or out_undef, or ramps linearly toward one
* of these ‘final’ values from its current analog output level.
* The speed at which this
* ramping occurs depends on the values of t_rise and t_fall. These parameters are
* interpreted by the model such that the rise or fall slope generated is always constant.
* Note that the dac_bridge includes test code in its cfunc.mod file for determining
* the presence of the out_undef parameter. If this parameter is not specified by you,
* and if out_high and out_low values are specified, then out_undef is assigned the
* value of the arithmetic mean of out_high and out_low. This simplifies coding of
* output buffers, where typically a logic family will include an out_low and out_high
* voltage, but not an out_undef value. This model also posts an input load value (in
* farads) based on the parameter input load.
