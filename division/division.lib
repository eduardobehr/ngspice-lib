* This function is a two-quadrant divider. It takes two inputs; num (nu-
* merator) and den (denominator). Divide offsets its inputs, multiplies them by their
* respective gains, divides the results, multiplies the quotient by the output gain, and
* offsets the result. The denominator is limited to a value above zero via a user spec-
* ified lower limit. This limit is approached through a quadratic smoothing function,
* the domain of which may be specified as a fraction of the lower limit value (default),
* or as an absolute value. This model will operate in DC, AC and Transient analysis
* modes. However, in ac analysis it is important to remember that results are invalid
* unless only one input of the divider is connected to a node that is connected to an
* ac signal (this is exemplified by the use of the divider to perform a potentiometer
* function: one input is dc, the other carries the ac signal).
