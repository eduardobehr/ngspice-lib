** TEMPERATURE TRANSIENT ESTIMATOR
* This component estimates the temperature of an element based on its power loss, which is fed into PowerIn
*  
*   PowerIn:                input heat
*   (TempOut-Tamb)/Rth:    output heat
*   Cth*dT/dt:             stored heat
*
* Note 1: this requires an integrator component with capability to set initial state condition
* Note 2: the initial temperature is assumed to be Tamb
* Note 3: usually, thermal transients are much longer than electrical ones.
*
* The 1st order differential is solved according to the following diagram:

*                      |                /       |              |
*                      |---------------< -1/Rth |<-------------|
*                                       \_______|

* Usage: one tipical example would be to measure the power output of a semiconductor with a wattmeter, and link
*  the power signal to the first terminal of this component. Then, given the correct parameters, an approximated
*  temperature estimation can be achieved, assuming the thermaldynamics behave as an RC electrical circuit.
